Extract high-level domain concepts and experts that reflect the main themes\r\n2. Avoid overly specific, generic, or off-topic named entities\r\n3. Focus on entities that contribute to understanding the document's core message\r\n4. Create relationships that show meaningful connections between entities\r\n5. Ensure entities are one-word encapsulations of key concepts when possible\r\n\r\nEntity Types to Focus On:\r\n- Domain concepts (e.g., \"Deterrence\", \"Entropy\", \"Sustainability\")\r\n- Experts and key figures (e.g., \"Einstein\", \"Kant\", \"Darwin\")\r\n- Organizations and institutions\r\n- Core themes and topics\r\n\r\nRelationship Guidelines:\r\n- Use clear, descriptive relationship types\r\n- Ensure relationships are semantically meaningful\r\n- Connect entities that have logical associations\r\n- Avoid creating relationships between unrelated entities\r\n\r\nAdditional Instructions:\r\n- Treat dates, numbers, revenues, and other non-entity information as properties rather than separate nodes\r\n- Focus on quality over quantity - fewer, well-chosen entities are better than many irrelevant ones\r\n- Consider the context and domain of the document when extracting entities\r\n"
